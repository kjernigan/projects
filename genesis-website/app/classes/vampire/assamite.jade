                | Often seen by other Kindred as dangerous assasins and diablerists, the Assamite are really guardians, scholars, and warriors that
                | wish to distance themselves from the constant struggle between the Antediluvians and Methuselahs. Living in relative isolation from
                | other vampires, the Assamite formed their own society, composed of three castes, Warriors, Sorcerers, and Viziers. This allowed them to
                | flourish as an Independent clan. Primarily based in the middle east, another stereotype of the Assamite is that they're all Muslim, despite
                | the fact that they embrace mortals from India, Pakistan, the Mediterranean, and rarely as far away as Europ and the Far East.

                br
                | Due to their Quietus discpline, Assamite vampires specialize in killing other vampires. Able to weaken all classes with Weakness and Infirmity,
                | they specialize in killing vampires thanks to Thinblood and Leech. Thinblood causes a vampire's regeneration ability to cost double the normal
                | amount of blood, and Leech allows the Assamite to drain the victim's blood and add it to their own blood pool. Due to balance issues, once the
                | target's blood is low enough, Leech will fail instead of instantly killing the victim. Like other vampires, Assamite should always keep Celerity
                | and Regeneration active in combat, and start a fight by using both Weakness and Infirmity on the victim. If the victim should ever dispel these
                | effects, refresh them. Against other vampires, they should use Thinblood, and then use Leech and Spit at their discretion. Against non-vampires,
                | Thinblood is not necessary, but Leech and spit are. When creating their equipment, they should focus on hitroll, armor class, health, and damroll.
