                | Malkavian vampires were cursed with insanity. There is no nice way to put it, they're all bat shit crazy. Despite this,
                | they are still formidable opponents. With a knack for trickery and foresight, they can be considered a useful ally, or
                | potentially one of the most deadly enemies ever faced. Despite their insanity, they are one of the most organized clans
                | of vampires, even though they themselves don't realize it. This is most likely a result of the psychic connection that
                | all Malkavian share, called the "cobweb". The underlying cause of the cobweb is unknown, but it is believed to be some action
                | of the Malkavian clan founder, if it isn't the founder himself. Malkavian usually serve one of two purposes, as seers and as
                | tricksters, sometimes both. Due to their insanity, their predictions and visions are usually muddled, confusing, or just plain
                | outrageous.

                | Malkavian are one of the tougher clans to play, having only one real offensive ability and fewer offensive or defensive buffs
                | than other clans. They make up for this by being able to command their victims, even while the victim has willpower active.
                | Mindblast's damage increases as the Malkavian's damroll increases, and has a chance to stun. It's not uncommon to see a Malkavian
                | toy with their victim and force them ro remove one or more pieces of equipment and then use Mindblast in an attempt to stun them.
                | Some prefer not to waste time playing tricks on their victim and instead just try to dominate them with mindblast. When creating
                | equipment, a Malkavian should focus in hitroll, damroll, armor class, and hp.
